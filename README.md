# TAD-LIF
We designed a method of event detection called leaky integrate-and-fire for transient-state action detection (TAD-LIF) to identify transient-state actions. TAD-LIF significantly reduces the amount of required computation and quickly locates the target actions.

# DCSNN
We proposed a novel deep compressed spiking neural network (DCSNN), which can accurately identify transient-state micro-gestures, and achieves orders of magnitudes of improvement in terms of power consumption, inference speed, and memory usage.
